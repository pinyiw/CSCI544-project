Mioposto in Seattle received negative feedback for its poor customer service and overpriced food, with some customers complaining of long waiting times, unfulfilled orders, and cold food. On the other hand, some customers appreciated the waiting staff at Mioposto and the cozy ambiance. The service at Schooner or Later in Long Beach was criticized as being very poor and indifferent, while the food was only average. However, some customers praised the splendid and fantastic service at other restaurants, such as the fun place and the one with attentive and friendly servers. The reviews suggest that good food alone is not enough to make a restaurant successful and that excellent customer service is also essential."
