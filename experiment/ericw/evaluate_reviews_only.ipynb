Super focused on his work but attentive enough to not keep us waiting on anything. We tried both the fresh oysters and the chargrilled and boy, were those phenomenal. My colleague and I had oysters at each restaurant we dined at to truly see who offered the best and Acme wins, hands down.\",\n",
              " 'OH MY!! A must try. We had no idea there would be a line but there is but definitely well worth it!! The oysters are amazing! Try them charbroiled as well. The bread and butter that comes with them is amazing. The crawfish puppies were incredible. Could eat them all day. Definitely did not want to leave, but felt rushed (only negative) to get out so they could turn the tables. Try to see if you can join the 15 Dozen Club!']"

They have a lot of dishes with very unique and distinct flavors. Overall, this is one of my favorite restaurants around. They also have a very good lunch special if you are ever nearby on a weekday.One of my favorite restaurants in Philly! Check out my full review. http://goodyummyeats.wordpress.com/2013/08/04/vientiane-cafe-best-laotianthai-in-philly/Wow!   Soooo full!    Great staff!   Delicious food!   BYOB!   Good times!      I loved the wings, tofu, and the catfish!     I can't wait until I'm back in town to visit.    It's slowly becoming my undisputed go to restaurant when I'm philly!   Also heard from a patron that Uber eats started delivering.    Wish I lived closer so I could enjoy more frequently.    Absolutely one of my favorite spots for a good meal!This is my kind of place - they use fresh everything and the seasonings are expert.  The service on Friday nights is fantastic.  \n",

            "\n",
            "Last time I ordered the Pho - my goodness, the bowl is so huge and served with two sauces - hoisin and siracha.  Very good and filling - I would order it next time with more veggies (they are very good at helping you with special orders)\n",

            "This is a BYOB and the prices can't be beat.  The menu keeps getting larger and I only wish I were closer to this place, as I would come here weekly for sure!Delicious. So delicious. Why do they not have a sign anywhere that says CASH ONLY? We definitely had to send my brother out to get cash when the bill came. Embarrassing.\n",
            "\n",
            "I had the Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) which were delicious. Though the menu said they'd be spicy, and they didn't even have a slow burn thing going on. Next time, I would get it spicier. Lots of beef in it though, they definitely did not skimp on that.\n",

            "The desserts here are so so good. A bit overpriced maybe ($6 a piece), but delicious. I had the sticky mango rice, my mother ate the chocolate banana egg roll, my brother had the banana tempura. All yummy.  My dad clearly made the right choice when he ordered the coconut ice cream. It came in half a coconut and there was SO MUCH ICE CREAM. I dont' know if they make it on location, or if they get it elsewhere, but I could definitely eat it every day.\n",

            "I'm going to drag my brother here for the rest of the time he's at UPenn. I'm into it.I have been in a couple of times. I would skip their Pad Thai, I like it a particular way and either you got it or you don't.  What I do like is a lot of other items, like the Sweet Basil Salmon or the NomNom salad. I have also seen plenty of other dishes float by that I am willing to try.\n",
            "\n",
            "There expansion seems to have paid off  and its now much more comfortable to sit and stay a bit.Delicious and authentic Thai/Laos BYOB that I would definitely try again.\n",

            "I don't usually wander too far into West Philadelphia but I'll have to make an exception for this place. With the cute interior and the papaya salad along with beef jerky was nothing short of amazing, I'll have to return sooner than later. Especially for the Thai tea as well. Some places make it watery but it was made just the way I liked it.\n",

            "They have a lot of Gluten-free and Vegetarian options, which is nice.My green curry was wonderful and filling.  Went for lunch with a friend, as she'd been before and loved it.  Our server was really sweet  and attentive.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was cash only, but it's printed prominently on the menu before you order.  Server helped me quickly find an ATM. Plans to go back are definitely in my future.\n"
